Part E : Business plan or activities in Thailand

1. Startup Name
2. Slogan (If any)
3. Please choose the startup sectors/ targeted industries /startup stage most relevant to your activities
Startup Sectors: TravelTech, GovTech/ EdTech
Targeted Industries: Transportation and Logistics industry, Digital Industry
Startup Stage: Idea
4. Business or activity plan in Thailand
- Develop a GTFS data management platform
- Develop a real-time (GTFS-RT) data serving platform
- Collaborate with Thai government agencies for data access (BTS, MRT)
- Integrate with Google Maps via Google Transit program
5. Business or products or services description
Product: 
- a user-friendly GTFS data management platform designed specifically for Thai government agencies to streamline the process of providing accurate public transport information (bus/train station locations, timestables, etc.)
- integration with public transport operators to collect real-time location data (BTS, MRT)
- possibly a tiny single-purpose Android app (I assume all bus drivers have an Android phone) to get real-time location of buses that don't have GPS trackers built-in
- a backend service collecting real-time location information and transofrming it into GTFS feed for Google Transit which would then show up on everyones' Google Maps
6. Business Model: Description of the idea and business model
The project, at least in its initial stage, has a non-profit focus, as it's primarily a public service initiative to improve the lives of Thai citizens and boost tourism.

There are some possibilities of offering that platform as a paid service to other Southeast Asian countries or expanding it for commercial transport operators in the long term
7. Mission: Description of your organization’s mission
"To empower cities in Thailand and beyond to provide accurate and accessible public transport information, making it easier for people to choose sustainable modes of transportation." 

But in reality I just want Google Maps public transport information for Bangkok to be as rich and interactive as it is in Tokyo, Taipei, and Singapore.
8. Vision: Description of your organization’s vision
"A future where seamless public transport information is readily available for every traveler and resident in Thailand, fostering a more connected and efficient society."

But then again, I simply believe that making keeping GTFS data up to date for Thai officials easy and finding cheap ways to get real-time location information for as many modes of transportation as possible buses would make Google Maps more useful in Thailand :)
9. Target market: Description of your target customers or clients
Thai government at first, other countries later.
10. Growth Strategy: Please explain your growth objectives and how you intend to develop your startup business
Phase 1: Develop the core platform, demonstrate the real-time demo, and achieve successful Google Maps integration in a pilot city/region.
Phase 2: Approach other Thai cities and the Ministry of Transport to expand the use of the platform.
Phase 3: Explore offering the platform as a paid service to other countries in the ASEAN region.
11. Why is your startup innovative? Please explain
Right now Thai cities seem to be missing many of the banifits of the Google Transit integration:
- there are no timetables for BTS and MRT on Google Maps
- there is no real-time information for any public transport on Google Maps
- there is little information on bus stops outside of Bangkok
12. Key persons in your organization/team
Name Title
Ruslan Doga co-founder
Rail Akhmetov co-founder
Total number of team members 2
13. Please specify your funding sources; a list of your funding sources that you already have or intend to apply for
self-funded
14. Why did you choose Thailand as your destination? Please explain
I like public transport in Bangkok, especially BTS, but it's missing the digital component and I can fulfill it.
15. Please explain how your business would benefit Thailand? Please explain
- Citizen Benefits: It improves the daily lives of residents through more informed travel decisions and encourages greater public transport use.
- Tourism Boost: Enhances the experience for tourists, making navigation easier and boosting Thailand's image as a modern, user-friendly destination.
