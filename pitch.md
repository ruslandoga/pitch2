# Better Public Transport Information in Thailand

by Ruslan Doga and Rail Akhmetov

---

# Executive Summary

Our objective is to enhance the availability and accuracy of public transport information in Thailand by adopting modern standards like [GTFS](https://gtfs.org) and [GTFS-RT,](https://gtfs.org/realtime) similar to those implemented in Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore. Initially focusing on the BTS and MRT systems, we aim to extend these improvements to the entire Thai public transport network.

We plan to collaborate with Thai government agencies to integrate this system across all widely-used mapping applications, including Google Maps. This integration will not only improve the convenience and efficiency of travel for tourists and residents alike but also reinforce Thailand's position as a leader in tourism and urban planning.

# What is GTFS?

General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a standardized format for public transport schedules and associated geographic information. It allows public transport data to be easily used in applications like Google Maps. It includes:

- [**Routes and Stops:**](#routes-and-stops) Information on where to catch buses or trains.
- [**Schedules and Frequencies:**](#schedules-and-frequencies) Clear timetables to help plan trips.
- [**Fares:**](#fares) Upfront details on journey costs.

# What is GTFS-RT?

GTFS Realtime offers live updates on public transit, ensuring riders are always informed with:

- [**Vehicle Locations:**](#vehicle-locations) Real-time tracking of buses and trains, so passengers know exactly where they are.
- [**Arrival Times:**](#arrival-times) Accurate predictions to prevent missed connections.

# Vehicle Locations

![bg right:40% contain](./img/ios-shibuya-real-time.PNG)

GTFS-RT enhances schedules with real-time vehicle locations. It shows where the vehicle is and its estimated arrival time.

---

# Arrival Times

![bg right:40% contain](./img/ios-shibuya-departures-detailed-past.PNG)

If the vehicle is late, GTFS-RT reports the delay. Google Maps clearly shows this in the user interface.

# Google Maps in Bangkok

Google Maps in Bangkok are useful but have room for improvement. For example, the BTS has some GTFS data like station locations. However, timetables and fares are not yet included. Additionally, GTFS-RT data is currently missing.

---

<!-- backgroundColor: #191919-->

# Timetable Issues

![bg right:40% contain](./img/ios-phloen-chit-fake-departures.png)

Google Maps on iOS and Android tries to estimate the timetable from [rules](https://www.bts.co.th/eng/service/timetable.html) like ["every 6 minutes,"](#tldr) which can be misleading.

---

# Interpolated Location

![bg right:40% contain](./img/ios-phloen-chit-fake-real-time.PNG)

Current train location is interpolated based on time. A quick way to identify it is to notice that the green "On Time" label is replaced with a gray "Scheduled".

# GTFS Data Management Platform

A simple and user-friendly platform tailored for Thai transit agencies to provide accurate public transport information for all popular map apps. Example of Google Maps:

1. Government officials use a website to enter and update their transport information.
1. The platform converts this data into a [GTFS Schedule archive.](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/)
1. [Google Transit](https://developers.google.com/transit) pulls the GTFS Schedule archive.
1. The schedule information is then displayed on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/about) as static data, including timetables, ticket fares, and more.

---

# GTFS-RT Data Collection and Serving Platform

A platform integrated with public transport operators to collect and provide real-time location data for all popular map apps. Example of Google Maps:

1. Real-time data, such as raw GPS data from BTS trains, is collected.
1. The platform transforms this data into a [GTFS-RT feed.](https://gtfs.org/realtime/reference/)
1. [Google Transit](https://developers.google.com/transit) pulls the GTFS-RT feed.
1. The real-time information is displayed on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/about) as dynamic data, including current train locations and estimated arrival times.

---

# (Optional) Mobile App

A potential Android app designed to collect real-time location data from buses that do not have built-in GPS.

1. Bus drivers install the Android app on their smartphones.
1. The app is manually activated when the bus is in operation.
1. The app collects real-time GPS data from the smartphone.
1. The app sends the GPS data to [the real-time platform.](#gtfs-rt-data-collection-and-serving-platform)
1. The real-time information is displayed on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/about) as dynamic data, including current bus locations and estimated arrival times.

# Innovation: Accurate Timetables

Our approach provides accurate, up-to-date timetables for map apps in Bangkok.

Currently, Google Maps (and other popular map apps) either shows BTS train departures as "every 6 min" (web) or interpolates them (iOS, Android), which is misleading. We ensure precise schedule information, improving user experience.

---

# Innovation: Real-Time Data

Currently, Google Maps (and other popular map apps) does not display real-time train locations, nor does it provide updates on delays or schedule accuracy. Our approach integrates real-time data for buses and trains, filling this gap with accurate, live information. This ensures users have up-to-date details on vehicle locations and any schedule changes.

---

# Other Innovations

- **User-Friendly Tools:** An intuitive website for officials and a mobile app for bus drivers to efficiently collect and manage GTFS data.

- **Seamless Map Apps Integration:** Ensures all data integrates smoothly with all popular map apps (Google Maps, Apple Maps, OpenStreetMap), enhancing user experience.

---

# Impacted Industry: Public Transport

Our project significantly impacts two key industries:
