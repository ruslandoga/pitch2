# Better Public Transport Information in Thailand

by Ruslan Doga and Rail Akhmetov

---

# Executive Summary

Our objective is to enhance the availability and accuracy of public transport information in Thailand by adopting modern standards like [GTFS](https://gtfs.org) and [GTFS-RT,](https://gtfs.org/realtime) as successfully implemented in Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore. Initially focusing on the BTS and MRT systems, we aim to extend these improvements to the entire Thai public transport network.

We plan to collaborate with Thai government agencies to integrate this system with Google Maps. This integration will not only improve the convenience and efficiency of travel for tourists and residents alike but also reinforce Thailand's position as a leader in tourism and urban planning.

# What is GTFS?

General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a standardized format for public transport schedules and associated geographic information. It allows public transport data to be easily used in applications like Google Maps. It includes:

- [**Routes and Stops:**](#routes-and-stops) Information on where to catch buses or trains.
- [**Schedules and Frequencies:**](#schedules-and-frequencies) Clear timetables to help plan trips.
- [**Fares:**](#fares) Upfront details on journey costs.

# What is GTFS-RT?

GTFS Realtime offers live updates on public transit, ensuring riders are always informed with:

- [**Vehicle Locations:**](#vehicle-locations) Real-time tracking of buses and trains, so passengers know exactly where they are.
- [**Arrival Times:**](#arrival-times) Accurate predictions to prevent missed connections.

# Vehicle Locations

![bg right:40% contain](./img/ios-shibuya-real-time.PNG)

GTFS-RT enhances schedules with real-time vehicle locations. It shows where the vehicle is and its estimated arrival time.

---

# Arrival Times

![bg right:40% contain](./img/ios-shibuya-departures-detailed-past.PNG)

If the vehicle is late, GTFS-RT reports the delay. Google Maps clearly shows this in the user interface.

# Google Maps in Bangkok

Google Maps in Bangkok are useful but have room for improvement.

For example, BTS Skytrain has some GTFS data like station locations and fares. However, timetables are not yet included. Additionally, GTFS-RT data appears to be largely missing.

<!-- class: invert -->
<!-- backgroundColor: #191919-->

# Timetable Issues

![bg right:40% contain](./img/ios-phloen-chit-fake-departures.png)

Google Maps on iOS and Android tries to estimate the timetable from [rules](https://www.bts.co.th/eng/service/timetable.html) like ["every 6 minutes,"](#tldr) which can be misleading.

---

# Interpolated Location

![bg right:40% contain](./img/ios-phloen-chit-fake-real-time.PNG)

Current train location is interpolated based on time. A quick way to identify it is to notice that the green "On Time" label is replaced with a gray "Scheduled" label.

# Innovation: Accurate Timetables

Our approach delivers precise, up-to-date public transport timetables using the widely recognized GTFS Schedule standard.

Currently, Google Maps shows BTS train departures as ["every 6 minutes"](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Phloen+Chit/@13.7484202,100.5365788,16z/data=!4m8!3m7!1s0x30e29edcfb15ae2b:0xb3f399fbdb9ddf6c!6m1!1v2!8m2!3d13.743044!4d100.548974!16s%2Fm%2F05f879r?entry=ttu) or estimates them on iOS and Android, which can lead to inaccuracies. This indicates that the GTFS data provided is incomplete and could be significantly improved.

---

# Innovation: Real-Time Data

Our approach collects real-time data from buses and trains and provides it as GTFS-RT.

Currently, Google Maps does not display real-time BTS train locations or provide updates on delays and schedule accuracy. This indicates a lack of GTFS-RT data in Thailand.

By implementing GTFS-RT, we aim to fill this gap, providing accurate, live information that enhances the user experience with up-to-date vehicle locations and schedule changes.

---

# Other Innovations

- **User-Friendly Tools:** An intuitive website for officials and a mobile app for bus drivers to efficiently collect and manage GTFS data.

- **GTFS Data Availability:** We will make GTFS data easily accessible, ensuring it can integrate with any platform that supports this standard.

- **Optimized for Google Maps:** We will take extra steps to ensure seamless integration with Google Maps due to its widespread use.
